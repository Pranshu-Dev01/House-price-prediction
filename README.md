## Description
A Regression type prediction model using *Random Forest Regressor* algorithm. It uses RÂ², MSE (Mean Squared Error) as the metric for prediction.

### Building Files
1) train_model.py: which has regression model code
2) requirements.txt: which has the required library names
3) House_Price_Predection.csv: .csv dataset which includes the data regarding counsumer forcast prediction
4) Dockerfile: which contains the commands to be run in docker

### Git & Other Commands used in Command Prompt
1) `mkdir <file_name>` to create the folder
2) `cd <file name>` to go inside the folder
3) `git init`, initializing folder as git repository
4) manually add all the files
5) `git add .` to add all the files into git track
6) `git commit -m "<message>"`, it commits whatever is there in the track
7) `git remote add origin <GitHub repository link>`, builds connection between git and github
8) `git push --set-upstream origin master`, sends all the files from git to github.


### Jenkins
1) created a new item with item name as **9. Counsumer forcast prediction**
2) selected *Freestyle project* as the item type
3) selected *Git* in **Source Code Management**
4) added *Execute Windows batch command* step in **Build Steps**
5) Saved the Configurations
6) Clicked build now
